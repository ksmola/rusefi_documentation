"Normally, a car's weight transfers from front to back as it brakes and accelerates, and from side to side as it corners. As the force on each corner changes, so does the grip available to that wheel; less weight equals less grip. Active shocks control this by varying the degree to which each spring's compresses and extends (as the springs are passive, these systems are sometimes known as semi-active)."

"yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces"

Furthermore, at highway speeds the suspension computer automatically engages sport mode (Airmatic - Sport mode 1 or 2 depending on the current speed), thus aiding safety by significantly reducing body roll in sharp turns.
